# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows the user to play against the computer. The game board is created using the create_board() function, which initializes the board with empty spaces represented by '-'. The display_board() function takes in the current game board and displays it to the players. The user_input() function prompts the user to input their desired row and column to place their symbol. The computer_input() function handles the computer's turn by randomly placing its symbol on the board, while also trying to win or block the user's moves, create fork opportunities, and play in the center or corners of the board. The game also has a function check_win() and check_fork() to check if the game is won or if there is a fork opportunity.
